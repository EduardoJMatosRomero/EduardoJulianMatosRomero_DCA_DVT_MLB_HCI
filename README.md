# Flight Ticket Price Analysis and Energy Consumption Forecasting

## Flight Ticket Price Analysis:

## Objective: The project explores market basket analysis using Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms to identify purchasing patterns. The goal is to determine the most frequently purchased items and the strongest association rules among them.
Key Findings: The top 10 most popular items include bananas, cheese, coffee, and milk. Strong associations were found between items like pasta, chicken, and milk with other grocery items.

## Tools Used: Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms were used to extract frequent itemsets and association rules, helping to understand consumer purchasing behavior.
Energy Consumption Forecasting:

## Objective: The project aims to forecast household energy consumption using time series analysis, specifically applying ARIMA models to predict appliance usage in a low-energy building.

## Key Findings: Energy consumption peaks in the evening hours and drops significantly during late night and early morning. The ARIMA model provided reasonable predictions but highlighted areas for improvement in forecasting accuracy.

## Tools Used: The ARIMA model was implemented to predict energy usage, and a custom dashboard was designed to visualize the results, particularly tailored for older adults (60+), focusing on clarity and ease of use.

## Dashboard Design:

An interactive dashboard was developed to visualize energy consumption and market basket analysis results. It was specifically designed for older adults, featuring large fonts, high-contrast colors, and simple, intuitive layouts to enhance accessibility.

## Overall Impact:

This project showcases the application of machine learning in both retail and energy sectors, providing valuable insights into consumer behavior and energy consumption patterns. The work demonstrates the effective use of data analysis and visualization techniques to solve real-world problems.
